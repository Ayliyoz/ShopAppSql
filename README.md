This is a project supposed to simulate a shop app.
The database of the shop is meant to be hosted locally on postgresql. The JDBC plugin is necessary for the code of the program to communicate with the given database.
The files used to set up the database with Docker Desktop have been shared in the "postgresql" folder.
The frontend of this app has all been done using Swing. Because of this, there are a couple classes with not a lot of code (App and AppFrame) and one class with a lot of code, responsible for 80% of the functionality of the app (AppPanel)
